/* Description: 

Before you start diving in to the table itself, your span elements are currently bolded. Create a span:not(.sr-only) selector and give it a font-weight property set to normal.

The :not() pseudo-selector is used to target all elements that do not match the selector - in this case, any of your span elements that do not have the sr-only class. This ensures that your earlier rules for the span[class~="sr-only"] selector are not overwritten.

Solution:  */

span:not(.sr-only) {
    font-weight: normal;

}
