/* Description: 

Give the parts of your building width and height properties with these values: 70% and 10% to .bb1a, 80% and 10% to .bb1b, 90% and 10% to .bb1c, and 100% and 70% to .bb1d. Remember that these percentages are relative to the parent and note that the heights will add up to 100% - vertically filling the container.
