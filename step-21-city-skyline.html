<!-- Description: 

The buildings are too spaced out. Squeeze them together by adding two empty div elements to the top of the .background-buildings element, two more at the bottom of it, and one more in between .bb3 and .bb4. These will be added as evenly-spaced elements across the container, effectively moving the buildings closer to the center.

Solution:  -->

<div class="background-buildings">
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div class="bb1">
        <div class="bb1a"></div>
        <div class="bb1b"></div>
        <div class="bb1c"></div>
        <div class="bb1d"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="bb2"></div>
    <div class="bb3"></div>
    <div></div>
    <div class="bb4"></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
</div>
