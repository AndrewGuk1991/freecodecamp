// Description: 

// Up until now, any time text.innerText was updated, the old text was erased. This time, use the += operator to add text to the end of text.innerText.

// Add the string " In your inventory you have: " - include the spaces at the beginning and the end.

// Solution: 

function buyWeapon() {
    if (gold >= 30) {
        gold -= 30;
        currentWeaponIndex++;
        goldText.innerText = gold;
        let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
        text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
        inventory.push(newWeapon);
        text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: ";
    }
}
