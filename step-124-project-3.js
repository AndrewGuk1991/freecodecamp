// Description:

// The Math object in JavaScript contains static properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. One of those is Math.random(), which generates a random number from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive). Another is Math.floor(), which rounds a given number down to the nearest integer.

// Using these, you can generate a random number within a range. For example, this generates a random number between 1 and 5: Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;.

// Following this pattern, use the addition operator (+) to add a random number between 1 and the value of xp to your monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power.

// Solution: 

monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
