// Description:

// Now that you have practiced working with if...else if...else statements, you can remove them from your code.

// Once you complete that, use let to declare a continueLoop variable and assign it the boolean false. Then use let to declare a done variable and assign it the value 0.

// Solution:

let continueLoop = false
let done = 0
