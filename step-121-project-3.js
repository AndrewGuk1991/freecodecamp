// Description: 

// On a new line, use the addition assignment operator(+=), to add the string " You attack it with your <weapon>." to the text value, replacing <weapon> with the player's current weapon. Additionally, remember that this line of text starts with a space so it will properly display.

// Solution: 

function attack() {
    text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
    text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + "."
}
