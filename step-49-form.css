/* Description: 

It would be nicer to have the label text appear above the form elements.

Select all input, textarea, and select elements, and make them take up the full width of their parent elements.

Also, add 10px of margin to the top of the selected elements. Set the other margins to 0.

Solution:  */

  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 0;
