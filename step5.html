Add another meta element within the head. Give it a name attribute set to "viewport" and a content attribute set to "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" so your page looks the same on all devices.

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
