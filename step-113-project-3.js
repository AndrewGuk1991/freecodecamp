// Description: 

// Following the same pattern as the fightSlime function, use that code in the fightBeast and fightDragon functions. Remember that beast is at index 1 and dragon is at index 2. Also, remove the console.log call from your fightDragon function.

// Solution: 

function fightBeast() {
    fighting = 1;
    goFight();
}

function fightDragon() {
    fighting = 2;
    goFight();
}
