// Description:

// A while loop will run over and over again until the condition specified is no longer true. It has the following syntax:

// Example Code
// while (condition) {
//   logic;
// }
// Use that syntax to declare a while loop with continueLoop as the condition. The body should be empty.

// Solution:

let continueLoop = false;
let done = 0;
while (continueLoop) {
  
}
