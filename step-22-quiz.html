<!-- Description: 

Even though you added a placeholder to the first input element in the previous lesson, this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input.

Remove the placeholder text from the first input element, relying on the label being the best-practice.

Solution: -->

<div class="info">
    <label for="student-name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="student-name" id="student-name" placeholder="" />
</div>
