<!-- Description:

Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset. Set to the value to utf-8 which tells the browser how to encode characters for the page.

Note that the meta element is a void element.

With that last change, you have completed the Cat Photo App project. Congratulations!

Solution: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
