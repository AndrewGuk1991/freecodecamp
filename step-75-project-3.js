// Description:

// There is a shorthand way to add or subtract from a variable called compound assignment. For example, changing num = num + 5 to compound assignment would look like num += 5.

// Update both lines inside your buyHealth function to use compound assignment.

// Solution: 

function buyHealth() {
    gold -= 10;
    health += 10;
}
