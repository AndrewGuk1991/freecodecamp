/* Description: 

To make the navigation buttons look more like typical buttons, remove the underline from the anchor tags.

Then, create a new selector targeting the navigation list elements so that when the cursor hovers over them, the background color and text color are switched, and the cursor becomes a pointer.

Solution:  */

    background-color: #dfdfe2;
    color: #1b1b32;
