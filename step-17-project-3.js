// Description:

// button1 is a variable that is not going to be reassigned. If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the const keyword to declare it instead of the let keyword. This will tell JavaScript to throw an error if you accidentally reassign it.

// Change your button1 variable to be declared with the const keyword.

// Solution:

const button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");
