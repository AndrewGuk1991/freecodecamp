// Description:

// Printing numbers won't result in a visually appealing pyramid. Now that you're outputting the formatted content of your rows array, it's time to update your original loop.

// Instead of pushing i to the array, push the value of your character variable.

// Solution:

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
    rows.push(character);
}
