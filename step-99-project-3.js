// Description: 

// If the player has purchased all of the weapons in the inventory, the player should not be able to purchase any more and a message should be displayed.

// Add an else statement for your outer if statement. Inside this new else statement, set text.innerText to "You already have the most powerful weapon!".

// Test your buyWeapon function again to make sure the message is displayed when the player has the most powerful weapon.

// Solution: 

function buyWeapon() {
    if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length - 1) {
        if (gold >= 30) {
            gold -= 30;
            currentWeaponIndex++;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
            text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
            inventory.push(newWeapon);
            text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
        } else {
            text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
        }
    } else {
        text.innerText = "You already have the most powerful weapon!";
    }
