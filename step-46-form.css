/* Description: 

During development, it is useful to see the fieldset default borders. However, they make the content appear too separated.

Remove the border, and add 2rem of padding only to the top and bottom of each fieldset. Be sure to remove the padding from the left and right.

Solution:  */

fieldset {
  border: none;
  padding-top: 2rem;
  padding-bottom: 2rem;
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-right: 0;
}
