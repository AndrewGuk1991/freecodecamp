// Description: 

// Just like array values, object properties are separated by a comma. Add a comma after your name property and add a button text property with the value of an empty array.

// Since the property name has a space in it, you will need to surround it with quotes.

// Solution: 

const locations = [
    {
        name: "town square",
        "button text": []
    }
];
