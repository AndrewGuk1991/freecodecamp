/* Description: 

Lastly, in the :root selector of the media query, redefine all four of the --window-color variables to use #777. When you're done, resize the window and watch it go from day to night.

Variables are primarily used with colors, and that's how you used them here. But they can be given any value and used on any property. Your project looks great!
