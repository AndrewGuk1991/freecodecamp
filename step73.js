// Description:

// Rather than having to pass i + 1 to your padRow call, you could instead start your loop at 1. This would allow you to create a one-indexed loop.

// Update your iterator to start at 1 instead of 0.

// Solution:

for (let i = 1; i < count; i++) {
    rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
