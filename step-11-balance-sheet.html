<!-- Description: 

Within each of your new th elements, nest a span element with the class set to sr-only year. Give them the following text (in order): 2019, 2020, and 2021.

Give your third th element the class attribute set to current.

Leave the td element empty. This element exists only to ensure your table has a four-column layout and associate the headers with the correct columns.

        <th><span class="sr-only year">2019</span></th>

        <th class="current"><span class="sr-only year">2021</span></th>
    </tr>
