// Description: 

// Now you can build the attack function. First, update the text message to say "The <monster name> attacks.", replacing <monster name> with the name of the monster. Remember you can use the concatenation operator for this.

// Solution: 

function attack() {
    text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks."
}
