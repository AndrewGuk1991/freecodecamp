// Description: 

// In your fightSlime function, set fighting equal to 0 - the index of slime in the monsters array. Remember that you already declared fighting earlier in your code, so you do not need let or const here.

// On the next line, call the goFight function.

// Solution: 

function fightSlime() {
    fighting = 0;
    goFight()
}
