// Description: 

// Create another property in your object called button functions. Give this property an array containing the three functions assigned to the onclick properties in the goTown function. Remember that these functions are variables, not strings, and should not be wrapped in quotes.

// Solution: 

const locations = [
    {
        name: "town square",
        "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],
        "button functions": [goStore, goCave, fightDragon]
    }
];
