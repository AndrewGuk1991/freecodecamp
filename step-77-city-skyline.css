/* Description: 

Don't worry about the space at the bottom, everything will get moved down later when you add some height to the element at the top of the building.

Add a repeating-linear-gradient to .fb1c with a 90deg angle, your --building-color4 from 0% to 10% and transparent from 10% to 15%.

Solution:  */

.fb1c {
    width: 100%;
    height: 80%;
    background: repeating-linear-gradient(90deg,
            var(--building-color4)0% 10%,
            transparent 10% 15%);
}
