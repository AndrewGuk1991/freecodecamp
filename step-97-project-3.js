// Description: 

// Now it is time to test your buyWeapon function. Right now, the gold amount is set to 50. But to properly see the results of your buyWeapon function, the amount should be set to something higher.

// To test your buyWeapon function, open up the console. Then click on the "Go to store" button followed by the "Buy weapon (30 gold)" button four times.

// Solution: 

let gold = 250;
