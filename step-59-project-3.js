// Description: 

// Add a second object to your locations array (remember to separate them with a comma). Following the pattern you used in the first object, create the same properties but use the values from the goStore function. Set the name property to store.

// Solution: 

const locations = [
    {
        name: "town square",
        "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],
        "button functions": [goStore, goCave, fightDragon],
        text: "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\"."
    },
    {
        name: "store",
        "button text": ["Buy 10 health (10 gold)", "Buy weapon (30 gold)", "Go to town square"],
        "button functions": [buyHealth, buyWeapon, goTown],
        text: "You enter the store."
    }
